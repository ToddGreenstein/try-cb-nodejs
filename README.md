try-cb-nodejs
===============

A sample application and dataset for getting started with Couchbase
4.0.  The application runs a single page UI for demonstrating query
capabilities.   The application uses Couchbase Server +  Node.js +
Express + Angular and boostrap.   The application is a flight planner
that allows the user to search for and select a flight route
(including return flight) based on airports and dates. Airport
selection is done dynamically using an angular typeahead bound to cb
server query.   Date selection uses date time pickers and then
searches for applicable air flight routes from a previously populated
database.

## Installation and Configuration
The steps below assume you are running a standalone couchbase instance
running kv, indexing, and query services on the same server where the
node application will also be running.  The config.json file in the
root of this application can be edited to handle more complex
topologies such as running couchbase server inside a vm.
 - [1] Install a Couchbase Server, with integrated query service, and
 start the server.   There is no need to manually configure the server
 through the admin UI, steps 3 and 4 (below) will **automatically**
 provision couchbase and the application.  - [2] Install Node.js - [3]
 Make a directory, clone this repo, install dependencies, start the
 application.  From a terminal:
	mkidr ~/try-cb git clone
	https://github.com/ToddGreenstein/try-cb-nodejs.git ~/try-cb
	cd ~/try-cb npm install node app.js
 - [4] Open a new terminal and run: curl -v -X POST
 http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/status/provisionCB - [5] Open a browser and
 load the url http://localhost:3000

## REST API DOCUMENTATION
#### GET /api/airport/findAll?search=<_search string_> [**RETURNS: {"airportname":"<_airport name_>"} for typeahead airports passed in the query string in the parameter "search"**] 	
--Used for Typeahead							
--Queries for Airport by Name, FAA code or ICAO code.

#### GET /api/flightPath/findAll?from=<_from airport_>&to=<_to
airport_>&leave=<_leave date_>&ret=<_return date_> [**RETURNS:
{"sourceairport":"<_faa code_>","destinationairport":"<_faa
code_>","name":"<_airline name_>","equipment":"<_list of planes
airline uses for this route_>"} of available flight routes**]
--Populates the available flights panel on successful query.
--Queries for available flight route by FAA codes, and joins against
airline information to provide airline name.

#### POST /api/status/provisionCB [**RETURNS: {JSON OBJECT} indicating complete**]
--Loads the dataset dynamically based on options in the "config.json" file.   
--If dataset="repo", the application will build a sample bucket called
"travel-sample" by loading raw json formatted air travel documents
from the file in try-cb/model/raw/rawJsonAir.js and dynamically build
scheduling information.  This is useful for learning how to
programitically build a bucket, perform ingestions of data and how to
become familiar with the CB SDK API.  --If dataset="embedded", the
application load the above information from the included sample bucket
within couchbase known as "travel-sample"
