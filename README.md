try-cb-nodejs
===============

A sample application and dataset for getting started with Couchbase 4.0.  The application runs a single page UI for demonstrating query capabilities.   The application uses Couchbase Server +  Node.js + Express + Angular and boostrap.   The application is a flight planner that allows the user to search for and select a flight route (including return flight) based on airports and dates. Airport selection is done dynamically using an angular typeahead bound to cb server query.   Date selection uses date time pickers and then searches for applicable air flight routes from a previously populated database.  

## Installation and Configuration
The steps below assume you are running a standalone couchbase instance running kv, indexing, and query services on the same server where the node application will also be running.  The config.json file in the root of this application can be edited to handle more complex topologies such as running couchbase server inside a vm.   

 - [1] Install a Couchbase Server, with integrated query service, and start the server.   There is no need to manually configure the server through the admin UI, steps 3 and 4 (below) will **automatically** provision couchbase and the application.
 - [2] Install Node.js
 - [3] Make a directory, clone this repo, install dependencies, start the application.  From a terminal:   

    mkidr ~/try-cb    
    git clone https://github.com/ToddGreenstein/try-cb-nodejs.git $ ~/try-cb   
    cd ~/try-cb    
    npm install    
    node app.js
    
 - [4] Open a browser and load the url http://localhost:3000

**NOTE**: Once the application has provisioned the cluster it will update the config.json file and set "autoprovision":false.  The app can then be stopped and started and it will not attempt to provision the cluster again.
